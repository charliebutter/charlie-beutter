                <h2><a class="accent-blue underline" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3607287706" target="_blank">Shadowed</a></h2>
                <p>Shadowed is a custom room for Escape Simulator 2, created for the game's first Build-a-Room competition where it placed in the top 10 out of 112 entries.

The result is a cohesive, atmospheric experience where paying attention to what you can and can't see is the key to everything.</p>
